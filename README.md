## Hi there 👋
I’m an AI & design builder who work at the intersection of **AI, design, and web development**, turning ideas into systems that look good and work well.

If something sparks my curiosity, chances are I’ll explore it, build it, and ship a version of it.

Alongside my personal work, I run **Polarite**, a design-focused studio where I work on branding, UI/UX, and digital experiences.

I’m especially interested in how **design thinking and engineering** come together to create scalable products.
